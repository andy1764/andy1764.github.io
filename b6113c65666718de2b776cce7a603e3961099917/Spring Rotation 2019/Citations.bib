	abstract = {Motivation: Brain imaging genetics, which studies the linkage between genetic variations and structural or functional measures of the human brain, has become increasingly important in recent years. Discovering the bi-multivariate relationship between genetic markers such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and neuroimaging quantitative traits (QTs) is one major task in imaging genetics. Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (SCCA) has been a popular technique in this area for its powerful capability in identifying bi-multivariate relationships coupled with feature selection. The existing SCCA methods impose either the ‚Ñì 1 -norm or its variants to induce sparsity. The ‚Ñì 0 -norm penalty is a perfect sparsity-inducing tool which, however, is an NP-hard problem.
Results: In this paper, we propose the truncated ‚Ñì 1 -norm penalized SCCA to improve the performance and effectiveness of the ‚Ñì 1 -norm based SCCA methods. Besides, we propose an efficient optimization algorithms to solve this novel SCCA problem. The proposed method is an adaptive shrinkage method via tuning œÑ . It can avoid the time intensive parameter tuning if given a reasonable small œÑ . Furthermore, we extend it to the truncated group-lasso (TGL), and propose TGL-SCCA model to improve the group-lasso-based SCCA methods. The experimental results, compared with four benchmark methods, show that our SCCA methods identify better or similar correlation coefficients, and better canonical loading profiles than the competing methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods in discovering interesting imaging genetic associations.

In this article, our goal is to assess association between transcriptomic and metabolomic data from a Predictive Health Institute (PHI) study that includes healthy adults at a high risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Adopting a strategy that is both data-driven and knowledge-based, we develop statistical methods for sparse canonical correlation analysis (CCA) with incorporation of known biological information. Our proposed methods use prior network structural information among genes and among metabolites to guide selection of relevant genes and metabolites in sparse CCA, providing insight on the molecular underpinning of cardiovascular disease. Our simulations demonstrate that the structured sparse CCA methods outperform several existing sparse CCA methods in selecting relevant genes and metabolites when structural information is informative and are robust to mis-specified structural information. Our analysis of the PHI study reveals that a number of gene and metabolic pathways including some known to be associated with cardiovascular diseases are enriched in the set of genes and metabolites selected by our proposed approach.},

We show that when the PMD is applied using an L1-penalty on vk but not on uk, a method for sparse principal components results. In fact, this yields an efficient algorithm for the ‚ÄúSCoTLASS‚Äù proposal (Jolliffe and others 2003) for obtaining sparse principal components. This method is demonstrated on a publicly available gene expression data set. We also establish connections between the SCoTLASS method for sparse principal component analysis and the method of Zou and others (2006). In addition, we show that when the PMD is applied to a cross-products matrix, it results in a method for penalized canonical correlation analysis (CCA).

Suppose that two sets of measurements are available on the same set of observations. Sparse CCA is a method for identifying sparse linear combinations of the two sets of variables that are highly correlated with each other. It has been shown to be useful in the analysis of high-dimensional genomic data, when two sets of assays are available on the same set of samples. In this paper, we propose two extensions to the sparse CCA methodology. (1) Sparse CCA is an unsupervised method; that is, it does not make use of outcome measurements that may be available for each observation (e.g., survival time or cancer subtype). We propose an extension to sparse CCA, which we call sparse supervised CCA, which results in the identification of linear combinations of the two sets of variables that are correlated with each other and associated with the outcome. (2) It is becoming increasingly common for researchers to collect data on more than two assays on the same set of samples; for instance, SNP, gene expression, and DNA copy number measurements may all be available. We develop sparse multiple CCA in order to extend the sparse CCA methodology to the case of more than two data sets. We demonstrate these new methods on simulated data and on a recently published and publicly available diffuse large B-cell lymphoma data set.},

Here, we provide a systematic review of genetic studies published between 2009 and 2012 where either ADNI APOE genotype or genome-wide association study (GWAS) data were used. We review and synthesize ADNI genetic associations with disease status or quantitative disease endophenotypes including structural and functional neuroimaging, fluid biomarker assays, and cognitive performance. We also discuss the diverse analytical strategies used in these studies, including univariate and multivariate analysis, meta-analysis, pathway analysis, and interaction and network analysis. Finally, we perform pathway and network enrichment analyses of these ADNI genetic associations to highlight key mechanisms that may drive disease onset and trajectory. Major ADNI findings included all the top 10 AD genes and several of these (e.g., APOE, BIN1, CLU, CR1, and PICALM) were corroborated by ADNI imaging, fluid and cognitive phenotypes. ADNI imaging genetics studies discovered novel findings (e.g., FRMD6) that were later replicated on different data sets. Several other genes (e.g., APOC1, FTO, GRIN2B, MAGI2, and TOMM40) were associated with multiple ADNI phenotypes, warranting further investigation on other data sets. The broad availability and wide scope of ADNI genetic and phenotypic data has advanced our understanding of the genetic basis of AD and has nominated novel targets for future studies employing next-generation sequencing and convergent multi-omics approaches, and for clinical drug and biomarker development.},

	abstract = {Background: To leverage the potential of multi-omics studies, exploratory data analysis methods that provide systematic integration and comparison of multiple layers of omics information are required. We describe multiple co-inertia analysis (MCIA), an exploratory data analysis method that identifies co-relationships between multiple high dimensional datasets. Based on a covariance optimization criterion, MCIA simultaneously projects several datasets into the same dimensional space, transforming diverse sets of features onto the same scale, to extract the most variant from each dataset and facilitate biological interpretation and pathway analysis.
Results: We demonstrate integration of multiple layers of information using MCIA, applied to two typical ‚Äúomics‚Äù research scenarios. The integration of transcriptome and proteome profiles of cells in the NCI-60 cancer cell line panel revealed distinct, complementary features, which together increased the coverage and power of pathway analysis. Our analysis highlighted the importance of the leukemia extravasation signaling pathway in leukemia that was not highly ranked in the analysis of any individual dataset. Secondly, we compared transcriptome profiles of high grade serous ovarian tumors that were obtained, on two different microarray platforms and next generation RNA-sequencing, to identify the most informative platform and extract robust biomarkers of molecular subtypes. We discovered that the variance of RNA-sequencing data processed using RPKM had greater variance than that with MapSplice and RSEM. We provided novel markers highly associated to tumor molecular subtype combined from four data platforms. MCIA is implemented and available in the R/Bioconductor ‚Äúomicade4‚Äù package.
Conclusion: We believe MCIA is an attractive method for data integration and visualization of several datasets of multi-omics features observed on the same set of individuals. The method is not dependent on feature annotation, and thus it can extract important features even when there are not present across all datasets. MCIA provides simple graphical representations for the identification of relationships between large datasets.},

	abstract = {The lack of control over covariates in practice motivates the need for their adjustment when measuring the degree of association between two sets of variables, for which canonical correlation is traditionally used. In most studies however, there is also a lack of control over the attributes of responses for the sets of variables of interest. In particular, a portion of the response variable may be continuous and the other discrete. For such settings, the traditional partial canonical correlation approach is restrictive, since a covariate-adjustment for a set of continuous variables is assumed. By ignoring the assumption of continuous variates and proceeding with a partial canonical correlation analysis in the presence of continuous and discrete variates, results in canonical correlation estimates that are not consistent. In this paper we generalize the traditional partial canonical correlation approach to covariate-adjustment by allowing the response variables to contain continuous, as well as discrete, variates. The methodology is illustrated with a psychiatric application for examining which sleep variables relate to which depressive symptoms, as measured by commonly used constructs that presents with both continuous and discrete outcomes.

	abstract = {We propose a new multivariate method, partial sparse canonical correlation analysis (PSCCA), for computing the statistical comparisons needed by population studies in medical imaging. PSCCA is a multivariate generalization of linear regression that allows one to statistically parameterize imaging studies in terms of multiple views of the population (e.g., the full collection of measurements taken from an image set along with batteries of cognitive or genetic data) while controlling for nuisance variables. This paper develops the theory of PSCCA, provides an algorithm and illustrates PSCCA performance on both simulated and real datasets. We show, as a Ô¨Årst application and evaluation of this new methodology, that PSCCA can improve detection power over mass univariate approaches while retaining the interpretability and biological plausibility of the estimated effects. We also discuss the strengths, limitations and future potential of this methodology.},

	abstract = {The Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a multi-center study assessing neuroimaging in diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring. Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) often represents a prodromal form of dementia, conferring a 10-15\% annual risk of converting to probable AD. We analyzed baseline 1.5T MRI scans in 693 participants from the ADNI cohort divided into four groups by baseline diagnosis and one year MCI to probable AD conversion status to identify neuroimaging phenotypes associated with MCI and AD and potential predictive markers of imminent conversion. MP-RAGE scans were analyzed using publicly available voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and automated parcellation methods. Measures included global and hippocampal grey matter (GM) density, hippocampal and amygdalar volumes, and cortical thickness values from entorhinal cortex and other temporal and parietal lobe regions. The overall pattern of structural MRI changes in MCI (n=339) and AD (n=148) compared to healthy controls (HC, n=206) was similar to prior findings in smaller samples. MCI-Converters (n=62) demonstrated a very similar pattern of atrophic changes to the AD group up to a year before meeting clinical criteria for AD. Finally, a comparison of effect sizes for contrasts between the MCI-Converters and MCI-Stable (n=277) groups on MRI metrics indicated that degree of neurodegeneration of medial temporal structures was the best antecedent MRI marker of imminent conversion, with decreased hippocampal volume (left {\textgreater} right) being the most robust. Validation of imaging biomarkers is important as they can help enrich clinical trials of disease modifying agents by identifying individuals at highest risk for progression to AD.},

	abstract = {A genome-wide, whole brain approach to investigate genetic effects on neuroimaging phenotypes for identifying quantitative trait loci is described. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1.5 T MRI and genetic dataset was investigated using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and FreeSurfer parcellation followed by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). One hundred forty-two measures of grey matter (GM) density, volume, and cortical thickness were extracted from baseline scans. GWAS, using PLINK, were performed on each phenotype using quality-controlled genotype and scan data including 530,992 of 620,903 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 733 of 818 participants (175 AD, 354 amnestic mild cognitive impairment, MCI, and 204 healthy controls, HC). Hierarchical clustering and heat maps were used to analyze the GWAS results and associations are reported at two significance thresholds (p{\textless}10‚àí7 and p{\textless}10‚àí6). As expected, SNPs in the APOE and TOMM40 genes were confirmed as markers strongly associated with multiple brain regions. Other top SNPs were proximal to the EPHA4, TP63 and NXPH1 genes. Detailed image analyses of rs6463843 (flanking NXPH1) revealed reduced global and regional GM density across diagnostic groups in TT relative to GG homozygotes. Interaction analysis indicated that AD patients homozygous for the T allele showed differential vulnerability to right hippocampal GM density loss. NXPH1 codes for a protein implicated in promotion of adhesion between dendrites and axons, a key factor in synaptic integrity, the loss of which is a hallmark of AD. A genome-wide, whole brain search strategy has the potential to reveal novel candidate genes and loci warranting further investigation and replication.},

	abstract = {Rapid development of DNA microarray technology has resulted in different laboratories adopting numerous different protocols and technological platforms, which has severely impacted on the comparability of array data. Current cross-platform comparison of microarray gene expression data are usually based on cross-referencing the annotation of each gene transcript represented on the arrays, extracting a list of genes common to all arrays and comparing expression data of this gene subset. Unfortunately, filtering of genes to a subset represented across all arrays often excludes many thousands of genes, because different subsets of genes from the genome are represented on different arrays. We wish to describe the application of a powerful yet simple method for cross-platform comparison of gene expression data. Co-inertia analysis (CIA) is a multivariate method that identifies trends or co-relationships in multiple datasets which contain the same samples. CIA simultaneously finds ordinations (dimension reduction diagrams) from the datasets that are most similar. It does this by finding successive axes from the two datasets with maximum covariance. CIA can be applied to datasets where the number of variables (genes) far exceeds the number of samples (arrays) such is the case with microarray analyses.},

	abstract = {1 Methods used for the study of species‚Äìenvironment relationships can be grouped into: (i) simple indirect and direct gradient analysis and multivariate direct gradient analysis (e.g. canonical correspondence analysis), all of which search for non-symmetric patterns between environmental data sets and species data sets; and (ii) analysis of juxtaposed tables, canonical correlation analysis, and intertable ordination, which examine species‚Äìenvironment relationships by considering each data set equally. Different analytical techniques are appropriate for fulfilling different objectives. 2 We propose a method, co-inertia analysis, that can synthesize various approaches encountered in the ecological literature. Co-inertia analysis is based on the mathematically coherent Euclidean model and can be universally reproduced (i.e. independently of software) because of its numerical stability. The method performs simultaneous analysis of two tables. The optimizing criterion in co-inertia analysis is that the resulting sample scores (environmental scores and faunistic scores) are the most covariant. Such analysis is particularly suitable for the simultaneous detection of faunistic and environmental features in studies of ecosystem structure. 3 The method was demonstrated using faunistic and environmental data from Friday (Freshwater Biology 18, 87-104, 1987). In this example, non-symmetric analyses is inappropriate because of the large number of variables (species and environmental variables) compared with the small number of samples. 4 Co-inertia analysis is an extension of the analysis of cross tables previously attempted by others. It serves as a general method to relate any kinds of data set, using any kinds of standard analysis (e.g. principal components analysis, correspondence analysis, multiple correspondence analysis) or between-class and within-class analyses.},
