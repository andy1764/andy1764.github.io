## Multiple MDMR (working title)
Let $D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_m$ be $n \times n$ distance matrices obtained on the same subjects and $X$ be a full-rank $n \times p$ design matrix


1. First, use MDS to obtain $m$ sets of coordinates $Z_1, Z_2, \ldots, Z_m$
2. Then concatenate these into an $n \times mn$ matrix $Z = \begin{bmatrix} Z_1 & Z_2 & \cdots & Z_m \end{bmatrix}$
3. We then regress $Z$ on $X$ using multivariate multiple regression (MMR)
4. Inference can be achieved through the sums of squares and cross products (SSCP) error $\text{SSCP}_E = Z^T (I-H) Z$ and regression
$$\text{SSCP}_R = Z^T H Z = \begin{bmatrix} 
Z_1^T H Z_1 & Z_1^T H Z_2 & \cdots & Z_1^T H Z_m\\
Z_2^T H Z_1 & Z_2^T H Z_2 & \cdots & Z_2^T H Z_m\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
Z_m^T H Z_1 & Z_m^T H Z_2 & \cdots & Z_m^T H Z_m\\
\end{bmatrix}$$
5. Several test statistics including Pillai's trace are based on these SSCP matrices<sup>1</sup> and can be evaluated using permutation testing or possibly through $F$ approximations (requires derivation)

## High-dimensional MMR
- For high dimensional settings where $\hat{E}$ is not necessarily invertible, many solutions have been proposed and generally fall into four major categories:


- **Alternative test statistics**
    - Dempster's trace<sup>1</sup>: $\DeclareMathOperator{\tr}{tr} \tr(\hat{H})/\tr(\hat{E})$
    - Schott's test statistic<sup>2</sup>: $\DeclareMathOperator{\tr}{tr} \sqrt{n-1} [\tr(\hat{H})/p - \tr(\hat{E})/(n-p-1)]$
- **PCA regression**<sup>3</sup>
- **Generalized inverse**<sup>4</sup>
    - Take Moore-Penrose inverse instead of matrix inverse
- **Regularization**
    - Both ridge<sup>5</sup> and LASSO<sup>6</sup> have been used to obtain regularized estimates $\tilde{E}$

# Dempster's trace
---
## Dempster's trace
- Similar in spirit to the original MDMR method
$$\DeclareMathOperator{\tr}{tr} F_{\text{MDMR}} = \frac{\tr(Z_1^THZ_1)}{\tr[Z_1^T(I-H)Z_1]}$$
- Applying Dempster's trace to this regression setting yields a Psuedo-F statistic
$$\DeclareMathOperator{\tr}{tr} F_{\text{D}} = \frac{\tr(Z^THZ)}{\tr[Z^T(I-H)Z]} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^m \tr(Z_j^THZ_j)}{\sum_{j=1}^m \tr[Z_j^T(I-H)Z_j]}$$
---

## Asymptotic property investigation
- McArtor et al. (2017) derived the asymptotic null distribution for $F_{\text{MDMR}}$ in several steps:
    1. Eigendecomposed $G = \sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k \phi_k\phi_k^T$ and noted that $\phi_k$ are "asymptotically normally distributed because they are linear combinations of the elements of $G$, which are *iid* if the rows of $Y$ are *iid*"
        - This result has not been validated in any other papers
        - Li et al. (2019) prove that the MDS points are asymptotically normally distributed for Euclidean distances under certain error models (unpublished results)
    2. Regressed the $k$ eigenvectors (treating each of the $n$ elements as samples) on $X$ to yield the fitted values $u_k = H\phi_k$ and residuals $r_k = (I-H)\phi_k$
    3. Rewrote the test statistic as
    $$F_{\text{MDMR}} = \frac{\tr(HGH)}{\tr[(I-H)G(I-H)]}=\frac{\sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k u_k^T u_k}{\sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k r_k^T r_k}$$
    4. Since $u_k^T u_k \xrightarrow{d} \chi^2_p$ and $r_k^T r_k \xrightarrow{d} \chi^2_{n-p-1}$ and all $u_k$ and $r_k$ are pairwise independent, $F_{\text{MDMR}}$ is "asymptotically distributed as a weighted sum of $n$ independent $\chi^2(p)$ variables divided by a weighted sum of n independent $\chi^2(n-p-1)$ variables"

## Dempster's trace challenges
- The test statistic and asymptotic distribution both depend on eigenvalues of each dissimilarity matrix $G_j$ and can be dominated by matrices with a larger trace
    - Still remains an open question of how to optimally rescale these matrices
- Several possible solutions
    1. Divide each $G_j$ by their top eigenvalue $\lambda_{j1}$
    2. Scale by the sum of eigenvalues $\DeclareMathOperator{\tr}{tr} \tr G_j$
    3. Set the sample distance variance $V = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{k,l} G_{k,l}^2$ of each $G_j$ equal to 1
    
    
--

- Asymptotically, we now have chi-squared random variables that are not necessarily independent of one another
    - Sum of weighted dependent $\chi^2$ has been investigated with some approximations derived<sup>1</sup>
    - Also depends on the relative magnitude of eigenvalues from each $G_j$

## Proposed test statistics
- Denote $\hat{E} = Z(I-H)Z$ as the SSCP error matrix and $\hat{H}$ as the hypothesis SSCP matrix
- After applying PCA to obtain the $n \times (n-p-1)$ score matrix, denote $\hat{E}_{PC}$ and $\hat{H}_{PC}$ the associated SSCP error matrix and hypothesis SSCP matrix
    - PCA is applied after dividing the Gower's matrices $G_1, G_2, \ldots, G_m$ by their top eigenvalue<sup>1</sup>


| Statistic            | Equation
|:---------------------|----------
| Psuedo-F (Dempster's)| $\DeclareMathOperator{\tr}{tr} \tr(\hat{H})/\tr(\hat{E})$
| Top PCs              | $\DeclareMathOperator{\tr}{tr} \tr(\hat{H}_{PC}(\hat{E}_{PC}+\hat{H}_{PC})^{-1})$
| Generalized inverse  | $\DeclareMathOperator{\tr}{tr} \tr(\hat{H}(\hat{E}+\hat{H})^+)$

# Simulation results
---

## Proposed simulation settings
- Let $n$ be the number of subjects, $m$ be the number of feature sets, and $q_j$ be the number of features within each set indexed by $j$
    - We generate separate feature sets via $Y_j \sim N(0, \Sigma_j)$, where $\Sigma_j$ may vary to simulate feature sets with different scales and covariance structures
    - Simple continuous and binary covariates can induce mean/variance shifts
    
    
- Potential simulation settings could vary across the following
    - Magnitude of covariate-induced shifts in mean/variance
    - Differences in variability within feature sets
    - Dependence among feature sets (possibly not as important)
    
    
- We now compare three methods
    - Traditional MMR (for $nq \leq n-2$)
    - Separate MDMRs
    - Psuedo-F statistic (Dempster's trace)
        - With various scaling options
---

## Previous simulation settings
- Let $n$ be the number of subjects, $m$ be the number of feature sets, and $q$ be the number of features within each set
    - To generate separate feature sets with dependencies, we simulate $m\times q$ dimensional features $Y \sim N(0, \Sigma)$, then split them evenly into $Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_m$
    - A simple binary covariate $x \sim \text{Bernoulli}\,(1/2)$ induces shifts along PC axes of $\Sigma$, $\sum_{k \in K} \gamma\boldsymbol{\phi}_k$, where $K$ is selected depending on the setting
--


- For each simulation settings, we conduct 1000 simulations
    - $999$ permutations to compute $p$-values
    - $\rho = 0.25, 0.75$: low or high correlation of $\Sigma$
    - AR(1) or between correlations, other structures for $\Sigma$
    - $m = 2, 3, 10$: varying number of feature sets
    - $q = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 100, 200$: potentially high dimensional features
--
- **Simple effects**
    - $K = 1$ and $\gamma = 3$
    - 25% of PCs and $\gamma = 0.7$
- **Complex effects**
    - 50% of PCs and $\gamma = 0.5$
    - $K = mq$ and $\gamma = 0.15$

- To decide on Dempster's trace versus PC test statistics, could use existing tests for diagonality<sup>1,2</sup>
    - Initial trials suggest that these tests are too sensitive due to independence of MDS axes
